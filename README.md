## Hi there 👋

I'm Kobi, a student interested in computer engineering, automation, and systems.  

I like working with hardware, repairing devices, and understanding how things function under the hood.

Outside of coding and school, you'll usually find me being outside, working out, and experimenting with things I'm curious about.

### Fun facts:
- Vinland Saga is my favorite anime.
- I do not like coffee.
